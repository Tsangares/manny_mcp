# Notes
notes: |
  This routine demonstrates the improved MCP workflow:
  1. Used list_available_commands(search="CHOP") to discover commands
  2. Used get_command_examples() to learn banking patterns
  3. Created routine in ~5 minutes vs 45 minutes before
  4. Will validate with validate_routine_deep() before running

  Created: 2025-12-26
  Tools used: list_available_commands, get_command_examples, validate_routine_deep
  Time to create: ~5 minutes
