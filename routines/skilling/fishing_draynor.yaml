# Execution notes
notes: |
  This routine uses the FISH_DRAYNOR_LOOP command which:
  - Walks to Draynor fishing spot
  - Fishes shrimp/anchovies until inventory full
  - Walks to Lumbridge bank
  - Banks fish
  - Repeats until stopped

  Created using the new MCP workflow:
  1. list_available_commands(search="FISH") - discovered FISH_DRAYNOR_LOOP
  2. validate_routine_deep() - verified all commands exist
  3. Ready to run!
