    delay_before_ms: 1000
    notes: |
      Object name is lowercase "tree" (case-sensitive!)

    delay_before_ms: 1000
    notes: |
      Use partial name "shrimps" to match "Raw shrimps"
      Format: <item> <object> (no action needed)

    delay_before_ms: 1000

# PITFALLS DISCOVERED:
# 1. Object name is lowercase "tree" (case-sensitive)
# 2. Action "Chop down" uses SPACE (args.split(" ", 2) allows spaces in action)
# 3. USE_ITEM_ON_OBJECT format is just "<item> <object>" - no action
# 4. Partial item names work (e.g., "shrimps" matches "Raw shrimps")

# After this routine:
# Player at (3089, 3091), ready for 05_cooking.yaml (cooking building)
