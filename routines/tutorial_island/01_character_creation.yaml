    # Note: startWithConfirm() runs for 30-90 seconds, then clicks Confirm
    # Bug: Currently also clicks Confirm when duration arg is passed - to fix later

    # Widget scanning doesn't work on this interface
    # Coordinates from analyze_screenshot

# PITFALLS DISCOVERED:
# - Widget scanning (find_widget, scan_widgets) returns 0 widgets for
#   the "Past Experience" dialogue. Must use coordinate-based clicking.
# - RANDOMIZE_CHARACTER with duration arg still clicks Confirm (bug)
