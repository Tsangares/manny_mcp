    description: "Click 'I'm an experienced player' button"
    # Widget 60882951 = group 928, the "Experienced player" option with "Select" action

# PITFALLS DISCOVERED:
# - Experience selection widget is group 928 (ID 60882951), NOT group 122 (7995392)
# - Use find_widget(text="experienced") to discover the correct widget ID
# - The "Experienced player" option has action "Select"
# - For experienced players, use 01_experience_selection.yaml (selects index 2)
