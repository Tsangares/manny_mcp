  - id: 1
    phase: "character_appearance"
    action: RANDOMIZE_CHARACTER
    description: "Randomize character appearance and click Confirm"
    # Note: startWithConfirm() runs for 30-90 seconds, then clicks Confirm
    # Bug: Currently also clicks Confirm when duration arg is passed - to fix later

  - id: 2
    phase: "experience_selection"
    action: CLICK_CHILD_WIDGET
    args: "7995392 0 static"
    description: "Click 'I'm brand new!' button"
    # Widget 7995392 = (122 << 16) | 0, static child index 0 = brand new

# PITFALLS DISCOVERED:
# - Widget scanning (find_widget, scan_widgets) returns 0 widgets for
#   the "Past Experience" dialogue. Must use coordinate-based clicking.
# - RANDOMIZE_CHARACTER with duration arg still clicks Confirm (bug)
