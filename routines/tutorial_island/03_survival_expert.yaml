      CRITICAL: Tutorial Island fishing spots use action "Net" not "Small Net"!
      This is different from main game fishing spots.
      Found by: QUERY_NPCS which now includes NPC actions after code update.

      CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Tutorial Island skills tab widget!
      - Widget ID: 10485808 (group 160, child 0 or 48)
      - Position: x=570, y=167
      - This is DIFFERENT from main game (35913809 does NOT work)
      - TAB_OPEN skills command also fails on Tutorial Island

# KEY PRINCIPLE:
# ALWAYS use widget IDs from this file or widget_reference.yaml
# NEVER use coordinate-based clicking (send_input click x y)
# Widget commands are reliable, coordinate clicks cause disconnections

# PITFALLS DISCOVERED:
# 1. Tutorial Island fishing spots have action "Net" not "Small Net"
#    - Fixed by adding NPC actions to QUERY_NPCS command output
# 2. TAB_OPEN skills command fails - widget not visible on Tutorial Island
#    - SOLUTION: Use CLICK_WIDGET 10485808 (group 160, not 548!)
# 3. Tutorial Island uses different widget groups than main game
#    - Skills tab: 10485808 (group 160) NOT 35913809 (group 548)
#    - Quest tab: 35913794 (group 548, child 66) - see 06_quest_guide.yaml

# VALIDATED COMMANDS:
# - CLICK_WIDGET 35913795 "Inventory"  # Opens inventory
# - INTERACT_NPC Fishing_spot Net      # Fish shrimp
# - CLICK_WIDGET 12648448 "Continue"   # Click continue in dialogue
# - CLICK_WIDGET 10485808              # Opens skills tab (Tutorial Island specific!)
