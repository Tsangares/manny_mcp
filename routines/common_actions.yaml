# STAIR CLIMBING
# ============================================
# Stairs require being close to them before interacting.
# The GOTO command can only path on the same plane - cannot cross floors.

# ============================================
# NOTES ON PLANE CHANGES
# ============================================
# - GOTO cannot change planes (floors)
# - Must use INTERACT_OBJECT with Staircase/Ladder
# - Always walk close to stairs first if not already nearby
# - Check plane number in game state to verify floor changes
# - Pattern: walk_to_stairs -> climb -> verify_plane -> repeat if needed
