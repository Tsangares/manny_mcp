      Chickens are level 1 - safe for any account.
      Drops: Feathers (5-15, ~3gp each), Raw chicken, Bones
      200 kills = ~2400 combat XP spread across attack/strength/defence

# Combat settings
combat_settings:
  combat_style: "Aggressive"  # For strength XP, or use "Accurate" for attack
  food: "Not needed"
  prayer: "Not needed"

# Notes
notes: |
  Why chickens for fresh accounts:
  1. Level 1 NPCs - completely safe even at level 3
  2. Drop feathers (~45gp/kill average) for early money
  3. Drop raw chicken - cook for food or sell
  4. Located right next to Lumbridge spawn

  After reaching combat level 10-15, graduate to cows:
  - routines/combat/cow_killer_training.yaml

  Expected results from 200 chickens:
  - Combat level ~10-12 (depending on starting)
  - ~3,000 feathers (~9,000gp)
  - ~200 raw chicken

loop:
  enabled: false  # Single run, then check progress
