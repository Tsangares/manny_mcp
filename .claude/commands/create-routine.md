description: Start the guided routine creation workflow
---

I'll guide you through creating a new OSRS routine using the improved workflow.

**Target**: Complete in 5 minutes with zero errors

Let me help you create a routine following best practices:

1. **What do you want to automate?**
   (Tell me the activity - fishing, combat, questing, etc.)

2. **I'll discover relevant commands**
   (Using `/discover` to find what you need)

3. **I'll show you examples**
   (Using `/examples` to learn proper usage)

4. **I'll create the routine YAML**
   (Following templates from ROUTINE_CATALOG.md)

5. **I'll validate it**
   (Using `/validate` to catch errors)

6. **I'll save it**
   (To the appropriate directory)
