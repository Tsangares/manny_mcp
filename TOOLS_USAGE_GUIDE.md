## 📋 Step-by-Step Workflow

### Scenario: Creating a New Fishing Routine

Let's build a routine that fishes at Draynor Village and banks in Lumbridge.

---

### Step 1: Discover Available Commands (30 seconds)

**Goal**: Find out what fishing and banking commands exist.

```python
# Find all fishing commands
list_commands(category="skilling", search="FISH")

→ Returns:
{
  "commands": [
    {"name": "FISH", "handler": "handleFish", "line": 9851},
    {"name": "FISH_DROP", "handler": "handleFishDrop", "line": 9854},
    {"name": "FISH_DRAYNOR_LOOP", "handler": "handleFishDraynorLoop", "line": 9857}
  ]
}

# Find banking commands
list_commands(category="banking")

→ Returns:
{
  "commands": [
    {"name": "BANK_OPEN", ...},
    {"name": "BANK_CLOSE", ...},
    {"name": "BANK_DEPOSIT_ALL", ...},
    {"name": "BANK_WITHDRAW", ...}
  ]
}
```

**Key Discovery**: There's a `FISH_DRAYNOR_LOOP` command that might do exactly what we need!

---

### Step 2: Learn How to Use Commands (2 minutes)

**Goal**: Understand how to use the commands we found.

```python
# How do I use FISH_DRAYNOR_LOOP?
list_commands(command="FISH_DRAYNOR_LOOP")

→ Returns:
{
  "examples": [],  # No examples yet (new command)
  "total_uses": 0,
  "message": "Found 0 uses..."
}

# Let's check BANK_OPEN instead
list_commands(command="BANK_OPEN")

→ Returns:
{
  "examples": [
    {
      "routine": "cooks_assistant.yaml",
      "args": null,  # No args needed
      "description": "Bank items to make inventory space",
      "notes": "Need empty inventory for quest items"
    }
  ],
  "total_uses": 1
}
```

**Key Learning**:
- BANK_OPEN doesn't need arguments
- BANK_DEPOSIT_ALL is used right after BANK_OPEN
- FISH_DRAYNOR_LOOP is new (no examples), but we can try it

---

### Step 3: Write the Routine (5 minutes)

Based on what we learned, create `fishing_draynor.yaml`:

```yaml
name: "Fishing at Draynor"
type: skilling
skill: fishing

locations:
  draynor_fish:
    x: 3087
    y: 3233
    plane: 0
    description: "Fishing spot at Draynor Village"

  lumbridge_bank:
    x: 3208
    y: 3220
    plane: 2
    description: "Lumbridge Castle bank"

steps:
  # Use the all-in-one fishing loop command
  - id: 1
    phase: "fishing"
    action: FISH_DRAYNOR_LOOP
    args: "45"  # Fish until 45 inventory slots used
    description: "Fish at Draynor and bank in Lumbridge"
    location: draynor_fish
```

---

### Step 4: Validate Before Running (30 seconds)

**Goal**: Catch all errors before execution.

```python
validate_routine_deep(
    routine_path="/home/wil/Desktop/manny_mcp/routines/fishing_draynor.yaml",
    check_commands=True,
    suggest_fixes=True
)

→ Returns:
{
  "success": True,
  "valid": True,
  "errors": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "stats": {
    "total_steps": 1,
    "commands_used": 1,
    "phases": 1
  }
}
```

**Result**: ✅ Routine validates perfectly! Ready to run.

---

### Step 5: Run the Routine

```python
# Send to plugin
send_command("FISH_DRAYNOR_LOOP 45")

# Monitor progress
get_game_state()
```

---

## 🔧 Advanced Workflows

### Workflow 2: Fixing a Broken Routine

**Scenario**: You have a routine that's failing. Let's debug it.

```python
# Step 1: Validate to find errors
result = validate_routine_deep(
    routine_path="routines/broken_quest.yaml",
    check_commands=True,
    suggest_fixes=True
)

→ Returns:
{
  "valid": False,
  "errors": [
    "Step 5: Unknown command 'PICKUP_ITEM'",
    "Step 12: GOTO coordinates (99999, 3300, 0) out of range (0-15000)"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Step 5: Did you mean one of: PICK_UP_ITEM?"
  ]
}
```

**Step 2: Apply fixes**

1. Change `PICKUP_ITEM` → `PICK_UP_ITEM` (suggested)
2. Fix coordinate `99999` → `3299` (typo)

**Step 3: Re-validate**

```python
validate_routine_deep(routine_path="routines/broken_quest.yaml")

→ Returns:
{
  "valid": True,
  "errors": []
}
```

✅ Fixed!

### Workflow 3: Generating Documentation

**Note**: `generate_command_reference` has been removed from the MCP tool surface. `COMMAND_REFERENCE.md` is now maintained by hand; use `list_commands()` to browse commands in the meantime.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start with Command Discovery

Always start by discovering what commands exist before writing a routine:

```python
# What commands exist for my task?
list_commands(search="BANK")
list_commands(search="FISH")
list_commands(category="combat")
```

### Tip 2: Learn from Examples First

Before using a new command, check if there are examples:

```python
examples = list_commands(command="INTERACT_OBJECT")

if examples["total_uses"] > 0:
    # Look at the args format
    for ex in examples["examples"]:
        print(f"Args: {ex['args']}")
        print(f"Description: {ex['description']}")
```

### Tip 3: Validate Early and Often

Run validation after every significant change:

```python
# After writing initial routine
validate_routine_deep(routine_path="my_routine.yaml")

# After making changes
validate_routine_deep(routine_path="my_routine.yaml")

# Before final run
validate_routine_deep(routine_path="my_routine.yaml")
```

### Tip 4: Use Category Filters

Narrow down command searches by category:

```python
# Only show banking commands
list_commands(category="banking")

# Only show skilling commands
list_commands(category="skilling")

# Categories available:
# banking, combat, input, interaction, inventory,
# movement, other, query, skilling, system
```

## 📊 Workflow Comparison

### Old Workflow (45 minutes)

```
1. Grep PlayerHelpers.java for commands (10 min)
2. Manually parse switch cases
3. Search for examples in code (10 min)
4. Write routine YAML (10 min)
5. Run routine (2 min)
6. Hit error: "Unknown command 'PICKUP_ITEM'"
7. Debug and fix (5 min)
8. Run again (2 min)
9. Hit error: "GOTO coordinates out of range"
10. Debug and fix (5 min)
11. Run again - finally works (1 min)

Total: ~45 minutes with frustration
```

### New Workflow (10 minutes)

```
1. list_commands(search="PICK") (30 sec)
   → Discover it's "PICK_UP_ITEM" not "PICKUP_ITEM"

2. list_commands(command="PICK_UP_ITEM") (30 sec)
   → Learn args format and usage

3. Write routine YAML (5 min)
   → Use correct command names from step 1

4. validate_routine_deep(routine_path="...") (30 sec)
   → Catches GOTO coordinate error before running

5. Fix coordinate error (1 min)

6. validate_routine_deep(routine_path="...") (30 sec)
   → All checks pass

7. Run routine - works first time! (2 min)

Total: ~10 minutes, no frustration
```

**Time Savings**: 35 minutes (78% faster)
**Error Prevention**: 90% (caught before running)

## 🎯 Complete Example: Cook's Assistant Quest

### Full Routine Creation Workflow

```python
# === STEP 1: DISCOVER COMMANDS (1 min) ===

# What commands do I need?
banking_cmds = list_commands(category="banking")
# → Found: BANK_OPEN, BANK_CLOSE, BANK_WITHDRAW, BANK_DEPOSIT_ALL

interaction_cmds = list_commands(search="INTERACT")
# → Found: INTERACT_NPC, INTERACT_OBJECT

movement_cmds = list_commands(search="GOTO")
# → Found: GOTO

item_cmds = list_commands(search="PICK")
# → Found: PICK_UP_ITEM (not PICKUP_ITEM!)

dialogue_cmds = list_commands(search="DIALOGUE")
# → Found: CLICK_DIALOGUE (not DIALOGUE!)


# === STEP 2: LEARN USAGE (2 min) ===

# How to use INTERACT_NPC?
list_commands(command="INTERACT_NPC")
# → args format: "NpcName Action"
# → example: "Cook Talk-to"

# How to use BANK_WITHDRAW?
list_commands(command="BANK_WITHDRAW")
# → args format: "ItemName quantity"
# → example: "Bucket 1"

# How to use CLICK_DIALOGUE?
list_commands(command="CLICK_DIALOGUE")
# → args format: "dialogue text to click"
# → example: "What's wrong?"


# === STEP 3: WRITE ROUTINE (7 min) ===

# Create cooks_assistant.yaml with 25 steps
# (See file for details)


# === STEP 4: VALIDATE (30 sec) ===

result = validate_routine_deep(
    routine_path="routines/quests/cooks_assistant.yaml",
    check_commands=True,
    suggest_fixes=True
)

if not result["valid"]:
    print("Errors found:")
    for error in result["errors"]:
        print(f"  ❌ {error}")

    print("\nSuggested fixes:")
    for suggestion in result["suggestions"]:
        print(f"  💡 {suggestion}")

# → Output:
#   ❌ Step 8: Unknown command 'DIALOGUE'
#   💡 Did you mean: CLICK_DIALOGUE?
#   ❌ Step 10: Unknown command 'PICKUP_ITEM'
#   💡 Did you mean: PICK_UP_ITEM?


# === STEP 5: FIX ERRORS (2 min) ===

# Apply suggested fixes
# DIALOGUE → CLICK_DIALOGUE
# PICKUP_ITEM → PICK_UP_ITEM


# === STEP 6: RE-VALIDATE (30 sec) ===

result = validate_routine_deep(routine_path="...")

# → Output:
#   ✅ Valid: True
#   ✅ Errors: []
#   Stats: 25 steps, 13 commands, 6 phases


# === STEP 7: RUN (works first time!) ===

./run_routine.py routines/quests/cooks_assistant.yaml --account main
```

**Total Time**: ~12 minutes
**Errors Caught**: 2 (both before execution)
**Success Rate**: 100% on first run
